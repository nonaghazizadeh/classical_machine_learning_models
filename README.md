# Classical Machine Learning Models

In this project, I’ve trained three traditional machine learning models - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM - on various datasets. I’ve also performed an evaluation of these models using different methods. Additionally, I’ve conducted some preprocessing tasks such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- A linear regression model has been utilized to predict the profits of startups based on features such as R&D expenditure, administration costs, marketing expenditure, and the state in which they operate.
- A Decision Tree model has been implemented to distinguish between malignant and benign forms of breast cancer.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been applied to eigenfaces for the purpose of classifying faces.
