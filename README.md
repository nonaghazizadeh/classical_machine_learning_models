# Classical Machine Learning Models

In this project, I’ve trained three traditional machine learning models - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM - on various datasets. I’ve also performed an evaluation of these models using different methods. Additionally, I’ve conducted some preprocessing tasks such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
